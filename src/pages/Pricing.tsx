    {
      question: "What's included in the quoted price?",
      answer: "Our quotes include all design, development, testing, and launch costs. You'll also get the specified support period and any training needed. The only additional costs are optional add-ons you choose and third-party services like hosting."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you determine the final price within the range?",
      answer: "The final price depends on specific requirements like number of pages, custom features, integrations needed, and design complexity. We provide a detailed quote after our discovery call so you know exactly what you're paying for."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my project needs change during development?",
      answer: "Minor changes are included, but significant scope changes will be discussed and quoted separately. We're flexible and want to ensure the final product meets your needs, but we also need to maintain project timelines and budgets."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
      answer: "Yes! We typically split payments into 3 parts: 40% to start, 40% at the design approval stage, and 20% at launch. For larger projects, we can discuss custom payment schedules that work for your cash flow."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the final result?",
      answer: "We include multiple review rounds during development to ensure you're happy with the direction. If you're not satisfied at launch, we'll work with you during the support period to address any concerns. Client satisfaction is our top priority."
    },
    {
      question: "Who owns the website after it's built?",
      answer: "You own everything - the design, code, content, and domain. We provide all source files and documentation. You're never locked in with us, though we hope you'll choose us for ongoing support and future projects."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide ongoing maintenance?",
      answer: "Yes, through our Care Plans. These include hosting, regular backups, security updates, performance monitoring, and content updates. Pricing varies based on the complexity of your site and level of support needed."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does each project type take?",
      answer: "Starter websites take 2 weeks, Growth projects take 3-4 weeks, and Scale projects take 4-8 weeks depending on complexity. Timeline starts after content is finalized and deposit is received. We'll give you a specific timeline in your proposal."
